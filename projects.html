                    <p>My deepest dive into technology was through the six-month <strong>Fab Academy</strong> course. For my final project, I created the <strong>Japoe Pot</strong>, a smart irrigation system for potted plants. It uses sensors to monitor soil moisture and automatically waters the plant when needed. This project integrated electronics, programming, and digital fabrication into a fully working prototype.</p>

                    <p>I had the distinct honor of presenting the Japoe Pot at the <strong>Bhutan Innovation Forum</strong>. Curated to support the vision of the Gelephu Mindfulness City, this event allowed me to connect with Nobel laureates and global thought leaders, sharing my work on an international stage.</p>

                    <p>Building on my fabrication skills, I participated in Makeathon events to design assistive technology for individuals with disabilities. My team created writing tools like <strong>grip holders and finger cushions</strong> to help students with cerebral palsy write more comfortably, teaching me the power of empathy in engineering.</p>

                    <p>I participated in the <strong>Aresam Space Settlement Design Competition</strong>, designing a large-scale habitat orbiting Mars. The project involved creating essential systems for housing, healthcare, and safety for thousands of residents. It provided invaluable insights into large-scale problem-solving and futuristic engineering.</p>
